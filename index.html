	<i><h2><b>hallo what is javascript?</b></h2><p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming
      language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time
      a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to 
      look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
      scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.</i>
      It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which 
      (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning
      Area.<p>

     <b><p>HTML</b> is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web 
content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content,
 for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
      JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating 
content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.
 (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of
 JavaScript code.)</p>
  
  
        A type provides a set of values from which an expression may take its values, and in JavaScript, we have a few primitive types:
  <br> 
 
	 <ul>
     <li>string</li>
     <li>number</li>
     <li>undefined</li>
     <li>null</li>
     <li>boolean</li>
     <li>symbol</li>
     </ul>

The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a simple text label as an example. <br>
We can mark it up using HTML to give it structure and purpose:
